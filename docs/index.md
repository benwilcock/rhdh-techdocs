Developers love :heart: Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)! Developer Hub makes creating, discovering, and managing enterprise software faster and more productive for everyone involved. With Developer Hub, applications and APIs deployed across your organisation become easier to find, easier to understand, and easier to control. Meanwhile, Red Hat's enterprise grade support ensures you get issues resolved quickly, while our growing and fully open source community around Developer Hub (and upstream CNCF Backstage) brings exciting new innovations and enhancements on a regular basis. 

Some of the worlds largest companies use Red Hat Developer Hub to:

* Build a self-service portal where developers are in control
* Promote the sharing and adoption of common best practices across development teams
* Improve access to critical services, documentation, and APIs
* Consolidate their developer dashboards in one central access point 
* Reduce the administrative burden for their Platform Engineers

!!! tip "RHDH Proudly Based On CNCF Backstage"

    Developer Hub is based on [Backstage](https://backstage.io) the open-source Internal Developer Portal (IDP) created by Spotify and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). CNCF Backstage enjoys a vibrant user community and a fast growing ecosystem of useful extensions called "[plugins](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/plugins "plugins")". Many leading platform vendors (including  Red Hat) are contributing [code](https://github.com/janus-idp "source code") to the Backstage project to ensure the developer experience is as rich and rewarding as possible.

*[IDP]: Internal Developer Platform - a system intended to make iy easier to develop, secure, operate, and manage applications running on your cloud infrastructure.
*[CNCF]: Cloud Native Computing Foundation
*[RHDH]: Red Hat Developer Hub
